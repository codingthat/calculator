# Simple, "Right-Side-Up" ðŸ˜‰ Calculator

A simple, responsive calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project replicates the UI design of a basic calculator with essential operations and is optimized for both mobile and desktop viewsâ€”but puts the numbers in [the same order as on a telephone](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/16666/why-do-numpads-on-keyboards-and-phones-have-reversed-layouts), for those who prefer it.
